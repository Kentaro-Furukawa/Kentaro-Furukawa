I have some experiences in the web development, had been worked at a web development firm in Tokyo, Japan, as a HTML coder for a little while. the job involved bit of Javascript and PHP. somehow I left and wonderd around different things for years. Then time passed, curretly I am working in the IT filed.

Thank you all.
